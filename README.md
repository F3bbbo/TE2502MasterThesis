To run the CPU library solution you need to create a folder named "gspaces" in the "Triplanner files" folder which lies inside the CPU_LCT project. In the gspaces folder you need to place all the provided header files and the triplanner lib file.

The triplanner dll file needs to be placed in the same folder as the executeable is residing in. Those folders are "GPU_LCT/Debug" and "GPU_LCT/Release"
